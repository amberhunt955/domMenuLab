// In the Intro to the DOM we selected, manipulated and created 
// DOM elements - this lab provides practice doing the same.

// This is the first of a two-part lab that builds a 
// menu bar with a slide-down submenu.

// Note: Several of the tasks in this lab would be better done 
// upfront in the markup or CSS instead of using JS, however the 
// goal of this lab is to provide practice modifying the DOM using 
// JS. In your projects, if the HTML or CSS is known in advance 
// and/or static (unchanging), code it in HTML and CSS!
